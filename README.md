# Simple-MIPS-Simulator

The repository contains the first homework of computer architecture : creating a simple MIPS simulator.



Task demand:

1. Load a specified MIPS text file1 and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file
   (disassembler). Please see the sample input file and disassembly output.
2. Generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator). It should also
   produce/print the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction.
   Please see the sample simulation output file.
